                    span(data-type="event" data-id="StGP") Great Purge
                    |was reaching its heights of terror. The craven, incompetent commissar for war, Marshal
                    span(data-type="person" data-id="KlVo") Kliment Voroshilov
                    |, told those assembled: “Happily, we have not as yet discovered many enemies in the army. I can say happily in the hope that there are not very many enemies in the
                    span(data-type="organization" data-id="RdAr") Red Army

                    span(data-type="person" data-id="KlVo") Voroshilov
                    |. “If we have wreckers in every branch of the economy, can we imagine that in one place alone, the
                    span(data-type="organization" data-id="WaDe") War Department
                    |, there are none?” said
                    span(data-type="person" data-id="VyMo") Molotov
                    |ominously. “It would be absurd to do so. The
                    span(data-type="organization" data-id="WaDe") War Department
                    |is a very large affair, and its work will be checked not now but a little later. And it will be examined very rigorously.”

                    span(data-type="organization" data-id="RdAr") Red Army
                    |was focused on its head, Marshal
                    span(data-type="person" data-id="MiTu") Mikhail Tukhachevsky
                    |. As brutal as

                    |in quelling opposition, using poison gas on revolting peasants, and executing reform-seeking sailors,
                    span(data-type="person" data-id="MiTu") Tukhachevsky
                    |was a brilliant advocate of armored warfare. But it was his very emphasis on military professionalism that struck at the principle of party loyalty—which meant, essentially, loyalty to
                    span(data-type="person" data-id="JoSt") Stalin
                    |. Added to

                    span(data-type="person" data-id="JoSt") Stalin’s
                    |ears with his sword. In what would become standard treatment at the hands of the

                    span(data-type="person" data-id="KlVo") Voroshilov
                    |, then received what became the standard consequence for such apostasy—a bullet to the back of the head. A corps commander close to Tukhachevky was arrested next, confessed in turn to plotting with
                    span(data-type="person" data-id="LeTr") Trotsky
                    |, and was shot as well.

                    |to sign a confession to being a Nazi spy. When his interrogation record was uncovered decades later after the fall of communism, the pages were splattered with blood—chilling evidence of the kind of force used to break the physically imposing
                    span(data-type="person" data-id="MiTu") Tukhachevsky
                    |. One of the generals, resigned to his fate, simply signed anything put before him to enjoy a comfortable cell, tea, and cigarettes for his last few days.
